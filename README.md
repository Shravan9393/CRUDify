# CRUDify

CRUDify is a full-stack CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application designed to manage tasks efficiently. This project demonstrates a modern web application architecture with a React-based frontend and a Node.js/Express backend connected to a MongoDB database.

---

## Project Description

CRUDify allows users to create, view, update, and delete tasks through a user-friendly interface. The frontend communicates with the backend REST API to perform all operations, making it a practical example of a decoupled client-server architecture.

---

## Frontend

The frontend is built using **React** with functional components and hooks. It provides an intuitive interface for managing tasks.

### Features:
- Display a list of all tasks
- Add new tasks
- Edit existing tasks
- Delete tasks
- Real-time updates after any CRUD operation

### Technology Stack:
- React (with hooks)
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- CSS for styling

### Structure:
- Components are organized under `src/component/`
- API calls are handled via utility functions in `src/utils/api.js`
- Styling is managed through CSS files

---

## Backend

The backend is a RESTful API server built with **Node.js** and **Express.js**, connected to a **MongoDB** database using **Mongoose** ODM.

### Features:
- CRUD endpoints for task management
- Middleware for parsing JSON and handling CORS
- Environment variable management with dotenv
- Development support with nodemon for hot reloading

### Technology Stack:
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB with Mongoose
- dotenv for environment variables
- cors for cross-origin resource sharing
- body-parser and cookie-parser for request parsing

### Running the Backend:
- Start the server using `npm run dev` in the backend directory
- The server listens for API requests and interacts with the MongoDB database

---

## Postman API Testing

You can test the backend API endpoints using Postman. Import the Postman collection from the following temporary link:

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm installed
- MongoDB instance running (local or cloud)

### Running Frontend
1. Navigate to the frontend directory: `CRUDify/fronted/crud application/`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the React development server: `npm start`

### Running Backend
1. Navigate to the backend directory: `CRUDify/backend/`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the backend server: `npm run dev`
